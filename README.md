Take your game development skills to the next level. Dive into the world of game creation confidently by elevating your game development skills. This book is your definitive and practical guide to unlocking the full potential of Unity 2023. Every chapter is designed to empower you to customize your own game, not just replicate what's in the book. This new edition includes immersive Augmented Reality (AR) experiences and performance optimization with Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS).

From Scene Creation to seamless Assert Integration, dive into C# programming and Visual Scripting with step-by-step guidance for beginners. Implement dynamic gameplay elements, including movement, spawning, physics, and health systems. Delve deeper into the magic of Game AI through sensor-driven decision-making with Finite State Machines (FSMs). Elevate your visuals with materials, shaders, textures, and particle systems. Optimize performance with Profiler insights and debug your game for a polished final product.

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, this book will equip you with the skills needed to bring your game ideas to life.

### Chapter 1, Embark on Your Unity Journey
Teaches you how to install and set up Unity on your computer,as well as how to create your fi rst project.
### Chapter 2, Crafting Scenes and Game Elements
Teaches you the concepts of Scenes and GameObjects the Unity way to describe what your game world is composed of.
### Chapter 3, From Blueprint to Reality: Building with Terrain and ProBuilder
It is where we will be creating our first level layout, prototyping it with the Terrain and ProBuilder Unity features.
### Chapter 4, Seamless Integration: Importing and Integrating Assets
It is where we will be creating our first level layout, prototyping it with the Terrain and ProBuilder Unity features.
### Chapter 5, Unleashing the Power of C# and Visual Scripting
It is the fi rst programming chapter of the book. We will learn how to create our first script using C# in the Unity way, and then we will explore how to do the same with Visual Scripting, the new node-based coding language of Unity.
### Chapter 6, Dynamic Motion: Implementing Movement and Spawning
Teaches you how to program the movement of your objects and how to spawn them. This chapter introduces the new Unity Input System. General programming knowledge is assumed from this point on.
### Chapter 7, Collisions and Health: Detecting Collisions Accurately
Teaches you how to confi gure the Physics settings of objects to detect when two of them collide and react to the collision, creating a health
system, in this case.
### Chapter 8, Victory or Defeat: Win and Lose Conditions
Covers how to detect when the game should end,both when the player wins and loses.
### Chapter 9, Starting your AI Journey: Building Intelligent Enemies for Your Game
Covers creating a basic AI using several Unity features for creating challenging enemies in our game.
### Chapter 10, Material Alchemy: Using URP and Shader Graph for Stunning Visuals
Shows how to use one of the latest Unity render systems (Universal Render Pipeline, or URP) and how to create eff ects with
the Shader Graph feature.
### Chapter 11, Captivating Visual Effeects: Harnessing Particle Systems and VFX Graph
Teaches you how to create visual eff ects such as water and fi re using the two main Unity tools for doing so, Particle Systems and VFX Graph, and how to make scripts that control them according to what’s happening in the game.
### Chapter 12, Enlightening Worlds: Illuminating Scenes with the Universal Render Pipeline
Looks at lighting, which is a concept big enough to have its own chapter. Here, we will deepen our knowledge of the Universal Render Pipeline, specifi cally its lighting capabilities.
### Chapter 13, Immersive Realism: Achieving Fullscreen Eff ects with Postprocessing
Teaches you how to add a layer of eff ects on top of your scene graphics using the postprocessing feature of the Universal Render Pipeline to get that film effect most modern games have today.
### Chapter 14, Harmonious Soundscapes: Integrating Audio and Music
Covers a topic that is underestimated by most beginner developers; here we will learn how to properly add sound and music to our game, taking into consideration its impact on performance. This also covers how to script the sound.
### Chapter 15, Interface Brilliance: Designing User-Friendly UI
Looks at the User Interface (UI). Of all the graphical ways to communicate information to the user, the UI is the most direct one. We will learn how to display information in the form of text, images, and life bars using the Unity UI system, and also how to script the UI.
### Chapter 16, Next-Gen UI: Creating Dynamic Interfaces with UI Toolkit
Looks at UI Toolkit, which is the successor of Canvas, the UI system we learned about in the previous chapter. We will explore it to get ahead and be prepared for Unity’s use of this HTML-based toolkit in the future.
### Chapter 17, Animated Realities: Craft ing Animations with Animator, Cinemachine, and Timeline
Takes us further than the static scene we have created so far. In this chapter, we will start moving our characters and creating cutscenes with the latest Unity features to do so, and how to script them.
### Chapter 18, Performance Wizardry: Optimizing Your Game with Profiler Tools
Discusses how making our game perform well is no easy task, but is certainly needed to release it. Here, we will be learning how to profile our game’s performance and tackle the most common performance issues.
### Chapter 19, From Prototype to Executable: Generating and Debugging Your Game
Teaches you how to convert your Unity project into an executable format to distribute it to other people and run it without Unity installed.
### Chapter 20, AR/VR
Teaches you how to create an AR application with Unity’s AR Foundation package, one of the most recent ways to create AR applications with Unity.
### Chapter 21, Massive Worlds: Introduction to DOTS
Teaches you how to start creating projects with DOTS, the new Unity technology that allows the creation of highly performant games to create complex gameplay involving thousands of objects on scene.
